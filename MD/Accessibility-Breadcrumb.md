# Breadcrumb
A breadcrumb trail consists of a list of links to the parent pages of the current page in hierarchical order. It helps users find their place within a website or web application. Breadcrumbs are often placed horizontally before a page's main content.

## Accessibility Features
1. The set of links is structured using an ordered list
2. A nav element labeled Breadcrumb identifies the structure as a breadcrumb trail and makes it a navigation landmark so that it is easy to locate
3. To prevent screen reader announcement of the visual separators between links, they are added via CSS:
	1. The separators are part of the visual presentation that signifies the breadcrumb trail, which is already semantically represented by the nav element with its label of Breadcrumb. So, using a display technique that is not represented in the accessibility tree used by screen readers prevents redundant and potentially distracting verbosity
	2. Each link has a border on one side that is skewed with the CSSâ€™ `transform ` property so it resembles a slash

## Behavior
1. A breadcrumb trail consists of a list of links to the parent pages of the current page in hierarchical order
2. Breadcrumbs are often placed horizontally before a page's main content

## Keyboard Support
No keyboard interaction needed.

|      | `aria-label=Breadcrumb` | `nav`   | Provides a label that describes the type of navigation provided in the `nav` element. |
|      | `aria-current=page`     | `a`     | Applied to the last link in the set to indicate that it represents the current page. |

## Attention

2. add `aria-current=page` to the last link ( last link )
